# Task 1 : Deploy an open source HuggingFace model as a realtime endpoint in AzureML

## Motivation
Playing with HF models on a local machine is fine, but I needed (a) a more powerful GPU than I currently have, (b) won't pay to use hosted services and (c) just wanted to learn. So I set about deploying this within my Azure test account.
